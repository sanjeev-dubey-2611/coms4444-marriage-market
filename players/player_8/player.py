"""Starting point for a group's player.

Copy this whole directory to ``players/player_<k>/`` using your group number,
then rename the class to ``Player<k>``. Group 4 would end up with
``players/player_4/player.py`` containing ``class Player4``. The registry looks
for exactly that; nothing else needs editing.

Keep the ``__init__.py``. Discovery uses ``pkgutil.iter_modules``, which only
reports directories that have one, so a group directory without it is silently
invisible to the simulator - no error, just a player that never turns up.

This directory is not itself discovered - the registry only matches
``player_<digits>`` - so the template can never appear in a run as a competitor.
